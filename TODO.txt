- Bug [current rounds]: Sort by date is not correct.

- In "Money Round" setup GUI, should pre-select "ALL"

- Add option to backup the DB. (Periodically, or on demand)

- Report GUI:
    - Print output should sort, perhaps on default column, or on column
      being used by GUI? -- might require a custom print control GUI?

    - Figure out print dialog preview problems?

    - Make Control-P print the report output

- On "Money Round" frame, and maybe on "List of Rounds" frame,
  show the number that played the money round (since it is not
  always the same as the number that played the regular round)

- Add tracking "weather" (as a free-form string) for each round?
  Not really useful for the overall report, but might be good
  for historical reasons? -- or could have a few choices for weather,
  like "sunny/rainy", "temp", "wind"? Seems like a bit much.

- Need A Way to get directly to an existing money round, without
  having to go through the round
- Handle Activation (double-click) of player in report list to
  show details on that player (some day)

- Disallow duplicate frames, e.g. for Round Scoring, choosing a round,
  money round scoring. more than one report frame should be ok

- on Commit, if no money round, as AreYouSure?

- when updating a round, if the date is changed, make sure
  the updated date does not match another record in the database.
  But of course if the date is not changed, it will match
  one and only one entry in the db, which corresponds to
  this round.

- Question: For counting 9-s, 18-s, and 33-s, what if, for example,
  somebody ties on the front 9. Do both folks get 9-s?

- update "Overall" column in RoundDetailsFrame when "Front 9"
  or "Back 9" updated for "Round Scoring" frame, in real time

- Add "Notes" to round detail entry? (for stuff DB doesn not cover?)

- Keep track of Aces, Eagles, and Ace-Eagles on a per-hole basis,
  e.g. have a drop-down radio-button list in the menu for each
  of the 18 hole -- hopefully not needed, except for by Gary

- Allow update of DB any time, but warn user that "calc is needed"
  if they have updated a front or back 9 score

- Sanity check; disallow new rounds in the future?
  What about too far in the past? Probably not needed.

- Break main status window into 2 parts: the first is the file
  name of the database, and the 2nd is for error messages
  (for which frame(s)?)

- As soon as any field changed in the Scoring GUI, update
  the status window to say "Edited"

- handle "E" as the number "0" (i.e. "even") for score fields,
  and display "E" instead of "+0" (enhancement). Display it this
  way too? (Might require a new "type" of integer?)

- display results graphically? Not sure what would be displayed yet.

- quit guessing what new round number will be, and actually let
  the database decide

- in general, use use the DB as the backend, with transactions,
  and never have to keep local copies of data? (may be slow?)
- use DB transactions for changes, so we can just update the DB, then
  throw it away if they say "no"

- make setup window become the scoring window for a round,
  instead of just replacing one window with the next (optimization)
  (and likewise for the setup-report->report transition)

- consider RETURN key in main window like Show/Edit button hit
  (optimization) (i.e. Default?, Focus?)

-------------------------------

- Support alternate/new Database files (why?)

- support DB modification for Courses and Players (some day),
  so I do not have to use sqlite3 directly, or write a program, to
  do this

- support modifying a round to add or remove a player,
  or even to remove a round? (not needed, and possibly evil)

- Properly package for distribution (for who?)

- implement real help? (like what?)

- preferences? not really needed yet: nothing to configure/prefer
  - e.g. which players are "usually there"
  - size of windows?
