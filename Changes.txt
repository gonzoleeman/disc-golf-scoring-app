History

version 1.18:
    * now using wxPython 3.0 widgets -> pubsub had changed
    * now using wxPrintout for printing, not "enscript"

version 1.17:
    * Moved DB initialization into CSV tables, one file for each, in
      the "preload" directory. First line of CSV file contains column
      name. CSV comment lines are skipped.
    * Added Done and Print buttons to report frame. Done just quites,
      but "Print" actually works, piping text data to enscript

version 1.16:
    * Now keeps track of mz kitty, on report screen, which
      took quite a bit of re-arranging, including breaking
      the round table into two: round and money round, and
      doing the same for the round detail, now round detail and
      money round detail. Assume that mz kitty only ges money
      if the round try-number field is "7", and then assume
      the number of players is the number you find in the
      money round detail table for that money round.

    displaying money won and best front and rear rounds. Also added
